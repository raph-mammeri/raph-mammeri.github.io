# Measure Theory Basics
## Introduction
Measure theory is a branch of mathematics that provides a rigorous framework for understanding and quantifying the concept of "size" or "measure" of sets. It deals with the study of measures, which are functions that assign a non-negative real number to subsets of a given set.


In probability theory,  measure theory introduces key concepts such as 
probability spaces, sample spaces and events. The numerical values that are 
assigned to events will capture the likelihood or uncertainty of outcomes.
These concepts establish a solid foundation for studying probabilistic 
models and their properties.



## Classes of sets
In this subsection we will give the definitions and basic results of some classes of sets that will allow us to define measurable sets and state the measure extension theorem cf. <a href="#measure_extension_theorem"><b>theorem</b></a>.


!!! definition
    Let $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. The class $\mathcal{A}$ is called  a **semiring** if :

    * $\emptyset \in \mathcal{A}$,
    * for any $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ then $B \setminus A$ is a finite union of mutually disjoint sets in $\mathcal{A}$,
    * $\mathcal{A}$ is $\cap$-closed i.e. closed under finite intersections.

    An **algebra** (resp. **$\sigma$-algebra**) if:

    * $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$,
    * $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under complements,
    * Closed under finite (resp. countable) unions, and we write $\mathcal{A}$ is $\cup$-closed (resp. $\sigma$-$\cup$-closed).

The $\sigma$-algebras are the classes of sets that will be considered as ***events*** in probability theory, and more generally the classes on which measures are defined.

!!! lemma
    The class $\mathcal{A}$ is an **algebra** if and only if:

    * $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$,
    * $\mathcal{A}$ is $\setminus$-closed i.e. for any $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ then $A \setminus B \in \mathcal{A}$,
    * $\mathcal{A}$ is $\cup$-closed.

    If $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra (resp. $\sigma$-algebra) then $\mathcal{A}$ is $\cap$-closed (resp. $\sigma$-$\cap$-closed).

!!! proof
    We leave the proof of the first part to the reader.
    The second part is a consequence of de Morgan's rule: $(\cup A_i)^c = \cap A_i^c$.

It is easy to show that for any arbitrary non-empty index set $I$ and $(\mathcal{A}_i)_{i \in I}$ a familly of algebras (resp. $\sigma$-algeras) the intersection $\cap_I\mathcal{A}_i$ is also an algebra (resp. $\sigma$-algebra).

!!! definition
    Let $\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ and $I$ the set of $\sigma$-algebras of $\Omega$ containing $\mathcal{E}.$
    The $\sigma$-algebra
    $$
    \sigma(\mathcal{E}):= \cap_{\mathcal{A} \in I}\mathcal{A}
    $$
    is called the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ is called a generator of $\sigma(\mathcal{E}).$

Note that in the definition above the index set $I$ is never empty since it contains the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{P}(\Omega).$
It is also clear from the definiton above that if $\mathcal{E}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra then $\mathcal{E}=\sigma(\mathcal{E})$
and if $\mathcal{E'} \subseteq \mathcal{E}$ then $\sigma(\mathcal{E'}) \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{E})$.
## Measure Spaces
  Let $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$,
  $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]$ a set function,
  $I$ an index set and $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ such that $A_i \in \mathcal{A}$ for any $i \in I$.
!!! definition
    We say that $\mu$ is :

    * **monotone** if $\mu(A) \leq \mu(B)$ for any $A \subseteq B$  in $\mathcal{A}$,
    * **additive** if $\mu(\cup_{i \in I}A_i) = \sum_{i \in I}\mu(A_i)$ for $I$ finite and $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ mutually disjoint,
    * **$\sigma$-additive** if $\mu(\cup_{i \in I}A_i) = \sum_{i \in I}\mu(A_i)$ for $I$ countable and $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ mutually disjoint,
    * **subadditive** if for any $A\subseteq \cup_{i \in I}A_i$ and $I$ finite we have $\mu(A) \leq \sum_{i \in I}A_i$
    * **$\sigma$-subadditive** if for any $A\subseteq \cup_{i \in I}A_i$ and $I$ countable we have $\mu(A) \leq \sum_{i \in I}A_i$

* sigma finite
* Measures
## Measure Extension Theorem

<a id="measure_extension_theorem"></a>
!!! thm
    Let $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ be a semiring and  $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]$ additive, $\sigma$-subadditive, $\sigma$-finite and $\mu(\emptyset)=0$.
    There exists a unique $\sigma$-finite measure $\tilde{\mu }$ on $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ such that for any $A \in \mathcal{A}$:
    $$
    \tilde{\mu }(A) = \mu(A)
    $$

??? proof "Sketch of the proof"
    The proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of these lectures however we give a sketch here of the construction of the extended measure $\tilde{\mu }$.
    From $\mu$ a set function $\mu^*$ on $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is defined as follows: for any $A \subseteq \Omega$:

    $$
    \mu^*(A):= \inf_{(A_i)_{i \in I} \in \mathcal{U}(A)} \sum_{i \in I} \mu(A_i)
    $$

    where $\mathcal{U}(A)$ is the set of countable coverings $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ of $A$ (i.e. $A \subseteq \cup_{i \in I}A_i$) with $A_i \in \mathcal{A}$ for all $i \in I$.
    The set function $\mu^*$ is an *outer measure* that defines a measure on the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}(\mu^*)$ of $\mu^*$-measurable sets. Moreover for any $A \in \mathcal{A}$, $\mu(A) = \mu^*(A)$, $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{M}(\mu^*)$ hence $\sigma(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathcal{M}(\mu^*)$  and $\mu^*$ is the unique measure that extends $\mu$ to $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$.

## Lebesgue-Borel Measure

The Lebesgue-Borel measure is a key concept in measure theory, providing a measure for subsets of  $\mathbb{R}^n$. It plays a crucial role in analysis, integration theory, and probability theory. It is a measure defined on the Borel sigma-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. It extends the concept of length in one dimension, area in two dimensions, and volume in three dimensions to higher-dimensional spaces.

### Borel Sigma-Algebra on Topological spaces

### Lebesgue-Borel Measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$
The Lebesgue-Borel measure $\lambda$ assigns a non-negative real number to each set in the Borel sigma-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is defined as follows:

1. For an open interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$, the measure of $I$ is given by its length: $\lambda(I) = \text{length}(I)$.
2. For a rectangle $R \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, the measure of $R$ is the product of its side lengths: $\lambda(R) = \text{length}(R_1) \times \text{length}(R_2) \times \ldots \times \text{length}(R_n)$.
3. The measure of any countable union of pairwise disjoint sets in $\mathcal{B}$ is the sum of their individual measures: $\lambda\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lambda(A_i)$.

By extending this definition to more complex sets, such as open sets, closed sets, and bounded sets, we can determine their Lebesgue-Borel measures as well.

### Properties of Lebesgue-Borel Measure
The Lebesgue-Borel measure possesses several important properties:

1. **Translation Invariance**: For any set $A \in \mathcal{B}$ and any vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the measure of the translated set $A + \mathbf{v}$ is the same as the measure of $A$: $\lambda(A + \mathbf{v}) = \lambda(A)$.
2. **Countable Subadditivity**: For any countable collection of sets $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ in $\mathcal{B}$, the measure of their union is less than or equal to the sum of their individual measures: $\lambda\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lambda(A_i)$.
3. **Approximation by Closed and Open Sets**: For any set $A \in \mathcal{B}$, there exist a closed set $F \subset A$ and an open set $G \supset A$ such that $\lambda(F) = \lambda(G)$.
4. **Regularity**: The Lebesgue-Borel measure is regular, meaning that for any set $A \in \mathcal{B}$, we can approximate its measure from within and from outside by certain well-behaved sets.

These properties make the Lebesgue-Borel measure a versatile and powerful tool for measuring sets in Euclidean space.
